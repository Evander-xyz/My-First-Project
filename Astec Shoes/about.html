        <h2>The Foundation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Yamez clan founded Aztec in 1999. A single brick and mortar
          location in San Jose, CA started it all. The Aztec brand was built on
          character, commuitment, and ingenuity. Presently,Aztec retail
          locations are located throughout the Southwest, and we are constantly
          expanding. That amazing growth from a single, humble location to over
          160 stores was accomplished by dedication, hard work, and a commitment
          to providing a warm, family-type atmosphere for our customers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          From the very start, Astec separated itself from the competition by
          making sales secondary to the customer. SP puts the consumer on a
          pedestal because they have been so instrumental in making us the huge
          success we are today. We would not be in our current position without
          the strength of our supporter's loyalty.
          <br /><br />
          To ensure that every one of our Aztec loyalists has a rewarding
          experience every time they step foot into one of our locations, we
          have hired employees who understand and uphold what Aztec was built
          upon. Our faithful and hard-working staff is an extension of the Astec
          culture.
          <br /><br />
          Aztec realizes that awesome customer service alone cannot make a
          business prosperous. We have also dedicated ourselves to carrying only
          the premium and in-demand footwear and apparel. We have an eye for the
          hottest styles and trends because we have an interest in the
          merchandise we sell.

      <h2>Our Culture</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        The yamez family chose athletic footwear and apparel as their profession
        because they knew that market and had a passion for it. The Aztec
        customers are chic and fanatical about their shoes and apparel. We make
        sure to supply them with the most stylish brand names available.
